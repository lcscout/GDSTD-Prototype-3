# Game Dev Sudy: Prototype 3
This is a simple recreation of the board game Quarto in Unity that was actually meant to be a fully-fleshed out project but it turned out to be just a study subject for online gaming and networking.

## Download
Since I shut down the game server I don't see a point in publishing a demo/release, but you can build it from a clone and play on your own server.

## Credits
I mainly used [LRM](https://github.com/Derek-R-S/Light-Reflective-Mirror) with Mirror for multiplayer and I have to say I truly enjoyed it.

## Requirements
This project requires Unity3D (2020.3+) to build and run. Clone this repository and open the "Quarto" folder in Unity.
