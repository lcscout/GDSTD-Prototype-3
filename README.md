# Game Dev Study: Prototype 3
This is a simple recreation of the board game Quarto in Unity that was actually meant to be a fully-fleshed out project but it turned out to be just a study subject for online gaming and networking.

If you'd like to know more about the project and the development process, check it's [page on my website](https://lucascoutinho.me/projects/gdstd3).

## Download
Since I shut down the game server I don't see a point in publishing a demo/release, but you can build it from a clone and play on your own server.

## Credits
I mainly used [LRM](https://github.com/Derek-R-S/Light-Reflective-Mirror) with Mirror for multiplayer and I have to say I truly enjoyed it.

## Requirements
This project requires Unity3D (2020.3+) to build and run. Clone this repository and open the "Quarto" folder in Unity.

## Credits
Created, designed, and developed by [Lucas Coutinho](https://lucascoutinho.me). Open sourced under the [MIT](https://github.com/lcscout/gdstd-3-unity/blob/main/LICENSE) license ❤️.
