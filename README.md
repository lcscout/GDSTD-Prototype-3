# GDSTD-Prototype-1
This was a small project I've made to test and study Unity's URP and TPS controlling.

Open sourced under the [MIT license](https://github.com/lcscout/GDSTD-Prototype-1/blob/main/LICENSE).

## Requirements
This project requires Unity3D (2020.3+) to build and run. Clone this repository and open the "GDSTD - Prototype 1" folder in Unity.
