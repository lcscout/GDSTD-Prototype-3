# GDSTD-Prototype-3
This is a simple recreation of the board game Quarto in Unity that was actually meant to be a fully-fleshed out project but it turned out to be just a study subject for online gaming and networking.

## Credits
I mainly used [LRM](https://github.com/Derek-R-S/Light-Reflective-Mirror) with Mirror for networking and I have to say I truly enjoyed it.

## Requirements
This project requires Unity3D (2020.3+) to build and run. Clone this repository and open the "Quarto" folder in Unity.
